// Stream is an implementation of eventstream.Stream that reads events from in
// an in-memory buffer.
//
// It is primarily intended as a cache of the most recent events from an
// application's event repository. Although the implementation details reflect
// and favor that use case, it is a well-behaved stream implementation that can
// also be used for testing and prototyping.
//
// The stream is "self truncating", dropping the oldest events when the size
// exceeds a pre-defined limit.
//
// The stream's buffer is implemented as an append-only singly-linked list. Each
// node in the list contains a single event. A linked list is used to allow the
// oldest events to be truncated from the buffer without invalidating cursors
// that may still be iterating through those events. Coupled with the use of
// atomic operations for reading the head and tail of the linked list, the
// stream's cursor implementation is lock-free.

	// that will never be buffered, rather than waiting until they timeout, or
	// worse yet blocking forever if their context has no deadline.

	// the next unused offset in the event repository before new events are
	// allowed to be produced.
